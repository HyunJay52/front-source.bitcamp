                Buoyant Air Turbines, or BATs, are roughly the size of shipping containers, hover at up to 1,000 feet, and are tethered to the ground with large, conductive cables.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">Why It Just Might Work: BATs, developed byAltaeros, have several advantages over traditional turbines. 
                They have significantly smaller carbon footprints, since they don’t require concrete foundations or fleets of semis to transport parts. 
                They’re mobile, so they can provide energy where needed, and they require less than 24 hours to deploy. 
                Installation doesn’t degrade habitat, and once aloft they fly so high they pose little risk to birds; traditional turbines in the United States alone kill half a million birds a year.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Why It Might Not: BATs are vulnerable to severe weather events, which are becoming increasingly common as the planet warms. Lightning or intense rain could ground an entire farm.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Climate Factor: A single BAT can produce twice as much energy as a traditional turbine, since winds blow more consistently at higher altitudes.
                Show Me the Money: Altaeros has launched a $1.3 million, 18-month pilot project south of Fairbanks, Alaska. Over the project’s lifespan, one BAT will power 12 homes at a cost of 18 cents per kilowatt-hour, half the going rate locally.</li>
